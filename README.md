# CoffeScript Exercises
I did these exercises while learning CoffeeScript. I'm using this book for
CoffeScript learning: [The Little Book on CoffeeScript](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13506289-the-little-book-on-coffeescript).

# Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/erenhatirnaz/coffeescript-exercises.git
cd coffeescript-exercises
npm install
npm test
```
